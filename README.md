Our Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to create a reservation page for boat rental.

What we did:
To make this site, we started with brainstorming ides, and settled on a boat reservation service. We began by making
the html skeleton, and progressed from there by adding css, and any other parts we felt necessary to have a great site.
We had scrum sprints that we would use as a reference to the current problems with the site.

IMPORTANT:
When testing the website, please start from the "index.html" document.
